# HiM
​​HiM (Hybrid iterative ptychographic super-resolution Microscopy)​​ is an advanced computational imaging method that synergistically combines a honeycomb array detection architecture with a hybrid high-frequency expansion algorithm. It achieves ~60nm super-resolution while significantly reducing photobleaching effects. This repository contains implementation code for super-resolution reconstruction and sample test data.
